# 💬 SOCKET CHAT 

Socket Chat is a simple full-stack chat app developed using JavaScript that allows the users to chat in real time using WebSockets. This small project was merely created to test and develop my skills on both client and server programming.


### ✨ App features

- 💬 **Real-time Chat**: Chat instantly with other users online.
- 👥 **Rooms**: Join different rooms for private conversations.




### 💡 What I've learned
* 💻 **Front-End**: I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS to crete a dynamic and interactive page facilitating data exchange with the Server and presentation on the screen.
* 🎛️ **Back-End:** I utilized ExpressJS and Socket.io to create the server-side app, handling the socket connections and allowing the exchange of information.
